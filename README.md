Hello, I'm CBGamesDev. I'm the sole programmer for a google site, which you can find with a quick google search. 

I mostly specialize in Flash Games, as I try to make all the games I had before, unblocked and playable still. 

Also, i'm learning how to code basic HTML websites (something I have succeded at!) So keep an eye out for some websites soon. Or never. I have an bad sense of time.
